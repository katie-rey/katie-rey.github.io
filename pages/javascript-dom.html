          <h3>Describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Html and CSS are best friends. Html is a builder, she enjoys creating houses using bricks and mortar. CSS
            is
            a creative soul and an interior designer by trade. He loves walking into a newly built house and decorating
            the walls with the brightest colours he can find.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Control flow is how your computer reads your code starting from the very first line (at the top) continuing
            to the bottom line.
            Control flow would be similar to following a recipe to bake bread. You would follow each instruction, step
            by step until the bread is made.
            <br>
            <br>
            A loop is an ‘iteration statement’, it continues to loop through the same code until it cannot loop any more
            or the result is false. I would compare a loop to the initial stages of making bread. To make bread, you
            need to create a starter of flour and water and feed it the same quantities of flour and water daily for
            one week. This could be written as a daily code that loops each day until the starter is ready
            to be used to make bread.

          <h3>What is the DOM and how do you interact with it</h3>
          <br>
          <p>The DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a programming interface that allows programming languages
            to interact with your HTML. The DOM turns all html/css data into nodes and objects that can be accessed and
            manipulated.
            <br>
            <br>
            The DOM is built using multiple APIs. So what is an API?
            <br>
            <br>
            An API is an application programming interface that allows programs to talk and communicate with each other.
            It takes a request and returns a response back to you. An example of this would be a website like Webjet
            that
            accesses numerous different airlines to return a selection of data. Webject accesses the airlines API to
            request selected data and return the results.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can interact with the DOM via the console, a ‘command line interface that can execute snippets of code’.
            From the console we can debug and manipulate code quickly.

          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h3>
          <br>
          <p>An object stores data and characteristics as keys and values. An example of this would be name: Katie or
            gender: female. The
            value can be any data type from a Boolean, a string or a number.
            <br>
            <br>

            An array is a variable that can hold more than one value which can be accessed by their index [position] in
            the array always starting from 0.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>To access a value in an object we use dot notation i.e family.brother. To
            access a value from an array we would need to use bracket notation i.e. family[0].
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>What are Functions and how are they useful</h3>
          <br>
          <p>A function is a reusable piece of code that performs a Javascript task. It requires an input and returns an
            output.
            <br>
            <br>
            First, you must declare or define a function with a name, secondly, give the function any parameters or
            arguments (or possibly none) in closed brackets after the function name. Then in curly brackets give the
            function a statement that defines the function.
            <br>
            <br>

            To enable to the function to run, we must then call the function using the function name and pass in any
            parameters/arguments.
            <br>
            <br>

            An example of this would be:
            <br>
            <br>

            function helloName(first, last) {
            <br>

            return “hello” + first + last
            <br>

            }
            <br>

            myName(katie, rey)
        </div>

      </div>

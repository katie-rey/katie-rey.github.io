          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>My long term goal and/or career pathway is to work full time in computer programming.
            I developed this pathway by getting to understand more about myself, what made me tick, what I enjoyed.
            Spending many years in a customer facing role, I came to realise I much preferred being in front of a
            computer. I love problem solving, researching and coding. I get a bit lost in a good way in it. </p>
          <p>I would like to become a junior developer in a larger team. Working in a supportive environment is super
            important to me, having worked in some not so supportive environments.</p>
          <h3> Description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
          <p>From my research, I have discovered my strengths are my problem solving skills, empathy for others,
            passion,
            and a tenacity to keep on learning.</p>
          <p>Having an understanding, my key strength is problem solving has definitely helped confirm for me computer
            programming would be a great career path. My tenacity to keep on learning has always been a strength,
            always
            wanting to push myself into something new. As my partner says “by hook or by crook, I’ll get the job
            done".
          </p>
          <p>My passion is something that really drives me. When I’m passionate about something, I get super excited
            and
            engaged.</p>

          <p>My limitations are lack of self-confidence, public speaking, procrastination and at times attention to
            detail.</p>
          <p>My procrastination has definitely had an effect on my learning, leaving tasks to the last minute. This is
            something I am aware of and am working towards changing. I am developing better time management strategies
            and
            tying to make myself accountable/responsible for my actions.</p>
          <p>Self confidence and public speaking go hand in hand. I’m really good one on one but tend to pull back
            within a group setting. I am actively trying to change this and want to engage more with the Slack
            channel.
          </p>
          <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
            Academy?</h3>
          <p>I would like to develop my group participation and oration built around self confidence. I would also
            like
            to develop my active listening skills by being more patient.</p>

          <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            • An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
            facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
          <p>My commitment on managing my workload:
            I will be on time and present everyday. I will be open minded to new ideas and patient. I will be kind and
            supportive, also allow myself to be supported where it is needed.</p>
          <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
          <p>When things are building up and getting to me, I will take time in that moment to clear my head and grab
            a cup of tea. I’m committed to seeking help and communicating with others around me.</p>

          <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>I am committed to seeking help once I have exhausted all personal avenues (as I really enjoy researching
            and problem solving). I will try to spend 1-3 hours on a problem, then seek help on Slack first. If I
            still
            require help, I will communicate with my facilitator.</p>


          <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>I expect support in both tech and core, active listening and honest constructive feedback and criticism.
          </p>
          <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example,
            you
            might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h3>
          <p>I do not have any current times to block-out, however my dog will miss me if I don’t walk him.</p>

          <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I have learnt though delving into personality types I am an INFP, a turbulent mediator, ever the idealist
            however self critical. What I found the most interesting is how my Myers Briggs result has changed from the
            last time I took the test (probably 10 or more years ago). The fundamental difference being my E (extrovert)
            has morphed into an I (introvert).
          </p>
          <p>
            I have learnt my key values are integrity, honesty and fairness and these values run through many areas of
            my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really do find it hard to ask for help
          </p>
          <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            Values: Understanding our values can give us a solid foundation of who we are. By understanding my values it
            has given me clearer picture of what drives me and how I behave. In learning and programming, I believe
            understanding my values can help drive my decision making, help me understand some of my strengths and
            limitations.
          </p>


          <p>
            Empathy: Empathy is so important in all aspects of relationship building. Having empathy builds awareness of
            others emotions, help see other peoples point of view and helping to resolve conflict.</p>
          <p>
            Self Awareness: Having self awareness helps to understand how you are feeling and to bring mindfulness to
            your emotions. Having self awareness also makes you see your strengths and weaknesses, bringing light to
            areas that you can improve on or areas that you can use to enhance your learning or programming.
          </p>
          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            How reflecting on yourself can have a huge impact on how you behave to yourself and others. By having a
            deeper understanding of your inner clockwork, I feel this helps to understand why you act/react in certain
            ways, or how you handle projects/problems etc
          </p>
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            The most challenging aspects were starting off the values and identity research (where do I begin!) and
            making my findings public. I’m now finding those two processes much easier to navigate.
          </p>
          <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
            learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
            Programming is not just about having great tech skills. Being able to work in a dynamic team, have empathy
            for others, be non-judgemental, having respect and be a great communicator both orally and as a listener
            makes you a great programmer.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
            that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <p>
            No I have loved learning core. I have found it fascinating to dig deeper into values and identity. I have
            even put my family through the Myers Briggs tests - this can given us some amazing insights into how we all
            communicate with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I hadn’t of learnt some of the key core subjects (growth mindset, problem solving), I would have really
            struggled to push through some of the tech weeks.

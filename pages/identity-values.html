          <h3>With the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
          <p>Gathering research to understand my core personal values has been a fascinating journey. To take time to
            deep dive and reflect on my background, upbringing and current journey is something that I haven’t really
            done
            before. Reflecting on what my true values are has made me truly reflect on what is important to me and how
            these values infer my behaviour.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Integrity</li>
            <li>Honesty</li>
            <li>Fairness</li>
            <li>Kindness</li>
            <li>Determination</li>
            <li>Authenticity</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values
            involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
          <p>I used to manage a large restaurant in Auckland. I had been told by junior staff, one of the managers was
            not being professional in their role.</p>
          <p>Choosing what steps to take next wasn’t an easy decision as the manager in question was also a friend of
            mine.
            As the GM, it was my responsibility to inform the owner and I knew this could mean the manager would be
            fired.
            Honesty was a value that I had to
            consider as well as my own integrity by ensuring I was following the correct path for the company.
            I chose to have a private meeting with the manger and not to tell the owner.</p>
          <p>By choosing kindness over integrity, I suffered the consequences by damaging my relationship with the
            owner.
            Honesty should have been at the forefront of my discussion given it was in a working environment.</p>
          <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
          <p>Coming from a welsh heritage, I believe my culture has shaped my vales and identity in many ways. We are a
            strong and proud nation, with a lot of resilience. I believe this strength has definitely shape my resolve
            and
            tenacity. </p>

          <h3> Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
            Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
          <p> I have discovered my strengths are my problem solving skills, empathy for others,
            passion, and a tenacity to keep on learning. My limitations are lack of self-confidence, public speaking,
            procrastination and at times attention to detail.


          <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with
            learning obstacles.</h3>
          <p>Problem solving and tenacity are the two biggest strengths that will have the biggest impact on my
            learning journey. As my partner said “by hook or by crook, I’ll get the job done”.</p>

          <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there
            was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
            reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
          <p>Working in a fast pace restaurant, there is always tension between FOH and BOH (front
            waitstaff/management
            and kitchen). One of the regular points of tension between the two would arise on a very busy day - kitchen
            would blame FOH staff for putting them in the weeds etc. Working in a tense environment can create a hostile
            and negative environment where words can be said in anger and frustration. </p>
          <p>One thing I didn’t do as a
            manager
            was to sit with the kitchen team after a busy day and tensions had dissipated, and complete a de-brief.
            Calm,
            communication in a relaxed environment would have been very beneficial to quell the frustrations of the day
            and enable a clean slate before the next rollercoaster of a day begins.</p>

          <h2 id="content-header">Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>Plato once wrote “all learning has an emotional base”. From this we can say that our emotions play a great
            part in our cognitive journey.</p>
          <p>
            From my research there a number of factors that determine EQ and IQ, some are listed below:</p>
          <h3 class="iq">IQ</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Use logic to solve problems</li>
            <li>Plan and strategize</li>
            <li>Understand abstract ideas</li>
            <li>Learn and adapt to change</li>
            <li>Grasp and use language</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="eq">EQ</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify emotions in yourself and others</li>
            <li>Empathize with other people</li>
            <li>Adapt your feelings and behavior to different situations</li>
            <li>Control your impulses</li>
            <li>Withstand temptations and delay gratification</li>
            <li>Resolve conflicts with others</li>
            <li>Communicate effectively</li>
          </ol>



          <p>From looking at the key points above, I feel EQ drives my relationship with myself and others, how I
            regulate
            and manage my emotions and those of others. Whereas IQ measures my reasoning ability and use of logic
            to determine an outcome.</p>

          <p>I have discovered EQ can be learned. Someone with a higher EQ can be less impulsive, think before they act
            and self regulate their emotions. A 2019 research established that possessing a higher EQ may also help to
            recover from
            acute stress.
            People who posses an higher EQ can also step down their state of anxiety and anger - this is called down
            regulation.
          </p>


          <p>The first steps to learn EQ are to be aware of your emotional state. This can be achieved through
            mindfulness and daily self check-ins. By being present and centered in the now, you can draw your attention
            to your current
            physical and emotional state and change it accordingly.</p>

          <p>Tony Robbins has identified six tips for growing EQ:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Identify what you’re feeling. Use mindfulness to routinely check in on your feelings from a more
              neutral
              perspective.</li>
            <li>Acknowledge and appreciate your emotions for what they are. Robbins (n.d.) emphasizes that “emotions are
              never wrong. They are there to support you.”/li>
            <li>Be curious about what an emotion is trying to tell you.</li>
            <li>Tap into your inner confidence to deal with emotions by remembering when you’ve done this effectively in
              the past.</li>
            <li>Mentally think through how you would deal with difficult feelings in the future to feel more equipped
              when the time comes.</li>
            <li>With a renewed confidence in your EQ, Robbins suggests getting excited to use these skills to achieve
              your goals and enhance your relationships with others.</li>
          </ol>

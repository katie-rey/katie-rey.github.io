          <h3>Discuss when you were blocked on a simple problem</h3>
          <p>
            Last week I felt blocked on many occasions. As I told my facilitator, I felt like I had
            been thrown into a deep pool and couldn't swim....and sharks were circling.
          </p>
          <p>
            My biggest block this week was based around the GradeBook challenge. Trying to push the value of the new
            score into the testScores array, I firstly over-complicated the function by adding in a loop.
            I made the assumption that by adding a new score you would have to loop over the name key to able to target
            that array.

            To solve the problem, I Googled the
            solution, compared three or more sites that explained the push() method and tried to establish its syntax. I
            then set up a separate js & html page in VSCode to practice and troubleshoot the errors in the console.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also did a bit more research on dot and bracket notation..."bracket notation is another way to access a
            property of an object". Throughout the process I kept on feeling frustrated. I chose to take breaks and
            sleep on the problem if it
            was taking too long.</p>
          <p>
            This week however was very different to last week. Instead of getting overwhelmed and
            letting a fixed mindset creep in, I chose to stay positive, relaxed and nurture my growth mindset
            mentality.
          </p>

          <p>
            A simple problem I solved in an elegant way was achieved by completing the deBuzz challenge. Instead of
            adding
            in
            each variant of the word buzz to filter (buzz, BUzz, buZZ - which I did initially), I converted the word
            toLowerCase.
          </p>
          <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem solving techniques/processes:</h3>
          <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
          <p>
            This week I wasn't that confident writing pseudocode code. What I have realised about my learning process is
            that I
            tend to rush in with test code before spending time to work out the problem step by step. This week I tried
            to spend
            more
            time reflecting on the problem before jumping in.
          </p>
          <h3>Trying something</h3>
          <p>
            I feel confident trying anything off the bat (yes I like cricket). I tend to jump in head first and see
            what happens,
            this
            can be a
            positive or a negative process. It can sometimes lead me down a wild goose chase for an hour or more.
          </p>
          <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
          <p>This is a new technique I'm coming to grips with. I have been using my partner as a bouncing board to talk
            to and
            found it has helped a lot. I want to become more comfortable in vocalising my challenges publically and not
            keep those thoughts internally.</p>
          <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
          <p>
            I feel comfortable reading errors messages and this has formed a large part of my problem solving arsenal
            this week. I have tried to strip each problem down to simpler elements and see if they throw any errors.
            Baby steps!
          </p>
          <h3>Console.logging</h3>
          <p>
            I had a revelation this week and realised how useful and important console.logging was! I will be using it a
            lot more in the future to test my code to see if I'm on the right track. In fact, I used it a lot this week
            along with taking the baby steps above.
          </p>
          <h3>Googling</h3>
          <p>
            I Google a lot and tend to find myself down a few rabbit holes with too many open tabs. This is one of my
            primary
            problem solving techniques which I find most useful. However, I need to remember to stay focused on one task
            at
            a time and limit my Googling time to 'x' minutes.
          </p>
          <h3>Asking your peers for help/Asking coaches for help</h3>
          <p>
            I'm not the greatest at asking for help from my peers or coach. This is something I'm actively working
            on and will try to improve on during Sprint 5. I tend to battle on through, thinking surely the answer is
            just around the corner! I appreciate my peers who do step forward and help in any way they can. This
            inspires me to be more vocal moving forward... a problem shared is a problem halved.
          </p>
          <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Reflecting with my partner has been very valuable. Spending time discussing my work process has given me
            clarity to understand what I do and how I do it. I've learnt through reflection, I tend to rush in, want to
            fix the problem quickly and find a solution. Thats not a
            bad thing though, right?
          </p>

          <h3>Discuss when you were blocked on a simple problem</h3>
          <p>
            Golly gosh - last week I felt blocked on many occasions. As I told my facilitator, I felt like I had
            been thrown into a deep pool and couldn't swim....and sharks were circling.
          </p>
          <p>
            My biggest block this week was based around the GradeBook challenge - trying to add an array inside an
            object and then accessing that information. To push a new score into the testScores
            array, I firstly over-complicated the function by adding in a loop. To solve the problem, I Googled the
            solution, compared three or more sites that explained the push() method and tried to establish its syntax. I
            then set up a separate js & html page in VSCode to practice and troubleshoot the errors in the console.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also did a bit more research on dot and bracket notation..."bracket notation is another way to access a
            property of an object".
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the process I kept on feeling frustrated. I chose to takes brakes and sleep on a problem if it
            was taking too long. This week however was very different to last week. Instead of getting overwhelmed and
            letting a fixed mindset creep in, I choose to stay positive, relaxed and nurture my growth mindset
            mentality.
          </p>

          <p>
            A simple problem I solve in an elegant way was achieved completing the deBuzz problem. Instead of adding in
            each variant of the word buzz to filter (buzz, BUzz, buZZ - which I did initially), I converted the word
            toLowerCase.
          </p>
          <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem solving techniques/processes:</h3>
          <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
          <p>
            I wasn't that confident writing pseudocode code. What I have realised about my learning process is that I
            tend to rush in with test code before spending time to work out the problem step by step. This week I spent
            more
            time reflecting on the problem before jumping in.
          </p>
          <h3>Trying something</h3>
          <p>
            I feel very confident trying something. I tend to jump in head first and see what happens. Ths can be a
            positive and a negative process.
          </p>
          <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
          <p>I am only starting to use this technique. I have been using my partner as a bouncing board to talk to and
            found it help a lot.</p>
          <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
          <p>
            I feel comfortable reading errors messages and this has formed a large part of my problem solving arsenal
            this week.
          </p>
          <h3>Console.logging</h3>
          <p>
            I had a revelation this week and realised how useful and important console.logging is! I will be using it a
            lot more in the future to test my code and see if I'm on the right track.
          </p>
          <h3>Googling</h3>
          <p>
            I Google a lot and tend to find myself down a few rabbit holes with way to many tabs open. This is my
            primary
            problem solving technique which I find most useful.
          </p>
          <h3>Asking your peers for help/Asking coaches for help</h3>
          <p>
            I am not the greatest at asking for help from my peers and coach. This is something I am actively working
            on and will try to improve on during Sprint 5.
          </p>
          <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
          <p>I have found reflecting with my partner very valuable. I have spent time discussing my work process and
            have discovered new ideas and strategies to implement. This was super helpful in understanding myself
            further. </p>

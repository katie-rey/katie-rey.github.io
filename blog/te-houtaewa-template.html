  <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa (PAGE heading)</h1>
  <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest
      runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>
  <h3>10 November 2010</h3>

  <p>
    Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother
    wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance
    away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people
    who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the
    hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On
    reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the
    foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately
    recognised.

    <h2 id="content-header">Values and Identity ðŸ¦¹</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Gathering research to understand my core personal values has been a fascinating journey. Reflecting on
      what my true values are has made me think about what is important
      to me and how these values infer my behaviour. My core personal values are:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Honesty</li>
      <li>Integrity</li>
      <li>Fairness</li>
      <li>Determination</li>
      <li>Authenticity</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>From my research, I have discovered my strengths are my problem solving skills, empathy for others,
      passion, and a tenacity to keep on learning. My limitations are lack of self-confidence, ability to orate
      in front of a group of people, procrastination and attention to detail.
